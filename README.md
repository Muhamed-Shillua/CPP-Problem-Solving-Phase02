# C++ Problem Solving

An advanced collection of C++ problem-solving exercises designed to push beyond the basics into more complex concepts like memory management, pointers, recursion, data structures, and modular design ‚Äî all through clean, reusable, and well-documented code.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **`Problems/`** ‚Äî Contains standalone `.cpp` files, each solving a specific problem.  
  Every file includes detailed inline comments explaining the logic and approach used.

##  Goal

To deepen my understanding of intermediate to advanced C++ concepts by applying them in practical problem-solving contexts ‚Äî building on the foundation set in Phase 01.

##  Learning Focus in This Phase

- Pointers and references
- Stack vs Heap memory
- Dynamic memory allocation (new/delete)
- Recursion and call stack tracing
- Manual memory management
- Modular code structure
- Real-world algorithmic thinking

##  Solution Philosophy
Each solution in this phase emphasizes:
- **Depth** ‚Äî Understanding not just *how* to solve a problem, but *why* the approach works and what trade-offs are involved.
- **Modularity** ‚Äî Functions are broken into logically isolated units with clear responsibilities.
- **Maintainability** ‚Äî Clean structure and consistent formatting for easier review and improvement.

##  Coding Style
This phase continues the *Clean Code* philosophy with increased discipline:
-  **Readable**: Structured flow with minimal indentation depth.
-  **Descriptive**: Functions and variables reflect real meaning.
-  **Minimalism**: Simplicity is enforced ‚Äî no premature optimization.
-  **Comment Clarity**: Only where they add value ‚Äî no noise.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Compile any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Example using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ Problems/Problem_001.cpp -o Problem_001
   ./Problem_001
